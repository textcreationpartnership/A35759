            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THey are ſuch who deſire that God would ſtrengthen and unite the Body of this Kingdom, and eſtabliſh it upon true Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, that it may not ſink under its own weight, or be expoſed to outward Violence.</p>
            <p>Such who deſire to live under his Majeſty in Love, Obedience and Loyalty, ſo that the meaneſt of them may receive Protection from his Greatneſs, and the Kingdom flouriſh under his happy Reign; and that his Sovereign Power be upheld by the Agreement of their minds, the continuance of which they all deſire to promote.</p>
            <p>They are ſuch who deſire to be careful of his Safety and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the Defence of which they are willing to venture their Lives and Fortunes, without being ſuſpitious or over-curious.</p>
            <p>They are ſuch who have a good Eſteem of their Princes Vertues, and Enquire not into his Behaviour with any other deſign than to imitate him in what is Good, and to render themſelves by that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance the more acceptable to him.</p>
            <p>They are ſuch who not only are willing to ſubmit themſelves to his Government, but alſo to thoſe who he thinks fit to place in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58828:2"/>over them, they never murmur at his Choice, nor add to his Cares, but rather ſtrive to leſſen them.</p>
            <p>They are ſuch who behave themſelves Reverently in his Preſence, not troubling him with tedious diſcourſes, or flattering inſinuations: but ſpeaking upon occaſion modeſtly, and with ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>They are ſuch who do not preſume to Petition for any thing that may not Lawfully be Granted, and ſcorn to impoſe upon their Princes Neceſſities, but willingly ſuſtain all Taxes, Tolls, Leavies, or other Impoſitions that may be neceſſary to their Princes Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſo their Prince may Govern them as Children, not as Slaves, as a Kind and Loving Father, not as a Rigorous and Severe Maſter. And they Eſteeming of him thus are willing to render him ſuch Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as is Solid and Sincere, not Falſe and Counterfeit.</p>
            <p>They are ſuch who deſire to demean themſelves ſo, that they may ſtir up his Affection that on the one ſide their Duty and Obſervance, and the other his Love and Juſtice may ſtrive for Victory.</p>
            <p>They are ſuch who deſire he may ſettle Peace and Concord through his own Dominions, and Valiantly Reſiſt <hi>Invading Enemies:</hi> And happily purſue all good Succeſs.</p>
            <p>They are ſuch who deſire he may not Expoſe himſelf to Danger unleſs in ſuch Exploits as is ſuitable to his Greatneſs, and in thoſe they deſire he may have an happy Iſſue.</p>
            <p>They are ſuch who deſire to Defend his Perſon from <hi>Treacherous Deſigns,</hi> and his Kingdom from ſuffering <hi>Alterations.</hi>
